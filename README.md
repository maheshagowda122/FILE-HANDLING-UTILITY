# FILE-HANDLING-UTILITY

*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*DOMAIN*: JAVA

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH

*DESCRIPTION*: As part of the CODTECH internship program, I developed a Java-based file handling utility to demonstrate the core capabilities of reading, writing, and modifying text files. The objective of this task was to create a functional script that efficiently performs file operations while ensuring the code is clear, well-documented, and easy to maintain.

The program, named FileHandlerDemo, enables the user to:

Write initial content to a text file (internship_data.txt),

Read and display the contents of the file,

Append new content based on user input, demonstrating file modification.

The task emphasizes real-world use cases such as generating completion certificates, recording internship data, and handling general-purpose file operations. This simulation aligns with file management tasks typically required in software development and back-end utilities.

The script is designed to be interactive and beginner-friendly, making use of Java‚Äôs BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, FileReader, and FileWriter classes. It also includes basic exception handling to ensure robust execution. The overall goal was to reinforce understanding of file handling mechanisms in Java while following clean coding practices.

This hands-on task gave me practical exposure to working within an IDE environment, managing Java projects, and understanding how input/output streams function in Java. It also strengthened my understanding of Java syntax, file classes, and exception handling‚Äîall of which are essential for backend and utility-based programming.
